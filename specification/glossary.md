### Nodes

Nodes are Computers/Servers which run pog's software. This software is what makes pog.network possible: anyone is able to create one of these to ensure and verify the safety and accuracy of the network and reach consensus.

### Consensus Mechanism

Finding consensus essentially means every node agreeing on reality: what transactions happened and when.
You can find more information on pog.network's specific consensus mechanism here: [Delegated Proof of Importance](protocol/consensus/dpoi.md).

### Prime Delegates/Delegate Nodes

To reach consensus, pog.network works similar to a representative democracy. Voting on you representatives happens continuously by entrusting them with your importance. The 128 most powerful accounts are chosen to vote on network decisions. They play a crucial part in the stability of the network by voting on [green addresses](#green-addresses) and by their votes being rebroadcasted by all other nodes.

### Green Addresses

Green Addresses are addresses of vetted, transparent and climate focused organizations or organizations supporting these. They live in a global pool of approved green addresses. To be added to this pool, more than 70% of online importance needs to vote in favor of the addition. However only 40% is required to remove these addresses again.

### Importance Score

Check out [Delegated Proof of Importance](protocol/consensus/dpoi.md)

### Online Importance Score

The total online importance score is calculated by sampling the total importance of all nodes every hour and by taking the mean of these values across a week.
