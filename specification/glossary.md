### Delegates / Delegate Nodes

Delegate Nodes are nodes which are part of the top 128 nodes with the highest online importance score. They play a crucial part in the stability of the network by voting on [green adresses](#green-addresses) and by their votes being rebroadcasted by all other nodes.

### Green Addresses

Green Adresses are adresses of vetted, transparent and climate focused organisations or organisations supporting these. They live in a global pool of approved green addresses. To be added to this pool, more than 70% of online importance needs to vote in favor of the addition. However only 40% is required to remove these addresses again.

### Online Importance Score

The total online importance score is calculated by sampling the total importance of all nodes every hour and by taking the mean of these values across a week.
