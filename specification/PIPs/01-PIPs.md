## Pog Improvement Proposals (PIPs)

A PIP is a documents describing features and standards relevant to the POG-Community.

PIPs are immutable. This means that the described facts can't change after it is released, however wording and formatting are free to be updated.

To update or invalidate an PIP, new PIPs can mark older ones as **updated** or **obsoleted**.

### Pog Request for Comments (PRCs)

PRCs are special forms of PIPs. Similar to the internet's Request for Comments, PRCs describe standards relevant to the POG network. These proposals describe application-level standards and conventions that aren't necessarily related to POG like **autonomous account** interfaces and wallet formats. These aren't critical to the core implementation of POG and are thus easier to create.

## Prior Works

PIPs are based on ethereum's pendant, [EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1).
