## Pog Improvement Proposals (PIPs)

A PIP is a document describing features and standards relevant to the POG-Community.

PIPs are immutable. This means that the described facts can't change after it is released; however, wording and formatting are free to be updated.

To update or invalidate a PIP, new PIPs can mark older ones as **updated** or **obsoleted**.

### Pog Request for Comments (PRCs)

PRCs are unique forms of PIPs. PRCs describe standards relevant to the POG network, similar to the internet's Request for Comments. These proposals represent application-level standards and conventions that aren't necessarily related to POG, like **autonomous account** interfaces and wallet formats. These aren't critical to the core implementation of POG and are thus easier to create.

## Prior Works

PIPs are based on Ethereum's pendant, [EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1).
