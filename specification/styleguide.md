# Style Guide (Work in progress)

## Specification/PIPs

- **Write in plain english**
  Everyone should be able to comprehend the specification. Try to prevent writing in mathematical notation when it is possible to express in simple language.
- **Document history**
  Changes should be communicated clearly and documentation about the start and updates of the network be kept. This doesn't apply to changes prior to publishing `PIP-2 Whitepaper`
- **Visualization**
  If something can be better understood with the help of a diagram or pseudocode: go for it. This website supports [mermaid.js](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
