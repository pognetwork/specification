    The POG.network specification is still a Work-In-Progress and isn't finalized yet.

# Introduction

POG.network is currently in a very early phase. Currently, we're working hard on formalizing our specification and finding out what we want to actually build. Still, we want to begin building something as soon as we have the basics about right and experiment in software to figure out any problems that might come up.

We're drawing inspiration from many projects, in particualy [ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), [nano](https://nano.org), [vite](https://vite.org) and [nem](https://nem.io).
These are all very mature projects with a huge amount of features, which pog is not: We want to create a minimal project to learn about distributed ledgers and only possibly expand it to a fully production ready cryptocurrency in the future.

Our Roadmap is available [here](https://github.com/orgs/pognetwork/projects/1) and on the left side you can find our first attempts at defining our protocol.
