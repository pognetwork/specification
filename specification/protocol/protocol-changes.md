# Protocol Changes

POG-Proposals are used to define standards and changes to the POG network. Currently, they don't play a huge role, since all decisions relevant to the first version of POG will be merged into **`PP-2: Whitepaper`**.

The definition of POG-Proposals itself is a POG-Proposal, whose initial version is below.

# PP-1: Pog Proposals

## POG-Proposals (PPs)

A PP is a documents describing features and standards relevant to the POG-Community.

PPs are imutable. This means that the described facts can't change after it is released, however wording and formatting are free to be updated.

To update or invalidate an PP, new PPs can mark older ones as **updated** or **obsoleted**.

### Pog Request for Comments (PRCs)

PRCs are special forms of PPs. Similar to the internet's Request for Comments, PRCs describe standards relevant to the POG network. These proposals describe application-level standards and coventions that aren't neccecarily related to POG like **autonomous account** interfaces and wallet formats. These aren't critical to the core implementation of POG and are thus easier to create.

## Prior Works

PPs are based on ethereum's pendant, [EIPs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1).
