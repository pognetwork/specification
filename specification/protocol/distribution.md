!!! warning
    The POG.network specification is still a Work-In-Progress and this page isn't finalized yet.

# The Initial Coin Distribution

* We run a campaign where you get POG for donations to climate focused ngoâ€™s, e.g per
planted tree. Users can already generate a wallet before the network launch where said POG will be send with the genesis block.
  * A small portion (5%?) of the total POG will be time locked and slowly paid out to the "founders" working on the protocol
  * Another small portion (5%?) will be paid to the foundation soley for funding green projects
  * Another small portion (2.5%?) will become a "ecosystem found" for applications improving the ecosystem (duh :smile: )
