    The POG.network specification is still a Work-In-Progress and this page isn't finalized yet.

# The Token Sale

During the initial distribution, 100% of pog will be distributed, there will be no hidden founder's package or secret pre-sale agreements.
100% of the profits gained in the initial token sale will be used for furthering our goal of making a positive impact to the earth's environment.
These funds will be spread across a variety of project reaching from re-forrestation to direct carbon capture. The final distribution will be fixed before we start the token sale.

In this sale, the amount of generated coins will be relative to the amount of donations in this event. This will lead to an initial valuation for each coin, similar to how mining gives bitcoin an inherint monetary value based on the resource costs associated with mining.

We don't see this as a pre-mine. This is essentially the initial mining phase before the network goes live, where everyone who is interested can take part in. All wallet addresses from POG Foundation will be public. Everything the money is used for will be 100% transparent.

To encourage individuals from contributing, there will be additional rewards for the first coins you claim which taper off. To ensure no foul play, we are working on a zero-knowled-proof based identity system for this.

## Supporting Developers

Initially, the first green wallet will be the POG Foundation. Prime Delegates are free to support other causes, however at least initially, the POG Foundation will be set as the first green wallet. Once the ecosystem stabilizes, we want to let the community decide on how they want to support as and use this as incentive for our organization to be accountable to the community.

The POG foundation will have three green wallets, one focused on protocol development, one for supporting the pog ecosystem and one exclusively used to support climate centric programs.
