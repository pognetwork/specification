# Delegates

## What are Delegates
   Delegate accounts are active accounts on the network that vote on the legitamacy of a new block.
   
## How to become a Delegate 
   Over time, an account builds up [network importance](dpoi.md) that shows other accounts that a account can be trusted.
   In addition to this, accounts on the network can transfer their importance to other accounts `delegate` their voting power and allow the more trusted account to have more voting power on the network. This results in a more secure network.
   The 100 most important accounts will become `prime delegates`.
!!! note "100 might have performance problems"
    This number may be changed at a later date after extensive network testing.

## Prime Delegates
   Prime delegates have the opportunity to suggest green wallets and vote for other green causes that they wish the network to support.
