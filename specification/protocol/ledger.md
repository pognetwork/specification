# Block-lattice

POG uses a special for of Directed Acyclic Graph which is based on a concept pioneered by the nano currency.
In this graph, each account has their own blockchain which can only be controlled with their private key. This enables POG to not 'ellect' leasders like other currency (e.g miners in bitcoin) which removes a major bottleneck and improves decentralization.
