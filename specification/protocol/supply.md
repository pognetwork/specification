    The POG.network specification is still a Work-In-Progress and this page isn't finalized yet.

There isn't any "mining" happening, so no new coins are distributed with blockrewards.

We are still pondering about if there should be rewards baked into the protocol. One Way we are thinking about would be as block rewards that aren't rewarded to the delegates producing these blocks but instead distributed to "green adresses" by these producers.
